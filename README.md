To run the code, use this command:
```
cabal run minecraft-dashboard
```
Then go to 
http://localhost:7879/main.html
^ For the dashboard
http://localhost:7879/index.html
^ For the login (I know the login is supposed to protect the dashboard but I did not have time for that)

This does not work on mac I dont think, I have not tested it there, try on windows or linux

I already added a list of refrences when I turned in this project as REFRENCES.txt

Cabal version:
```
cabal-install version 3.16.0.0 
compiled using version 3.16.0.0 of the Cabal library (in-tree)
