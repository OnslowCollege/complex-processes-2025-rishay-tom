To run the code, use this command:
```
cabal run minecraft-dashboard
```
Then go to 
http://localhost:7879/main.html
^ For the dashboard
http://localhost:7879/index.html
^ For the login (I know the login is supposed to protect the dashboard but I did not have time for that)

Press "Create Server" to actually create the server and when its done, press "start server"

Intergrations is how you can see stuff like player count from who is in the minecraft server, go to intergrations, then press "Enable Minecraft", then press
"Enable minecraft on home page" 

This does not work on mac I dont think, I have not tested it there, try on windows or linux

I already added a list of refrences when I turned in this project as REFRENCES.txt
